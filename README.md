### Creational patterns

\- provides object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse existing code.

| Design Pattern                                      | Practice completed?  |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| [Factory Method](/Creational/Factory%20Method/)     | ✅                    |
| [Abstract Factory](/Creational/Abstract%20Factory/) | ✅                    |
| Builder                                             | ❌ Seen often in .NET |
| [Prototype](/Creational/Prototype/)                 | ✅                    |
| Singleton*                                          | ❌                    |

*Even though I have used the Singleton pattern before, it seems to be considered as an anti-pattern. See: [CSharpInDepth - Singleton](https://csharpindepth.com/Articles/Singleton) and [SO - Singletons are bad](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/40373/so-singletons-are-bad-then-what).

### Structural patterns

\- explains how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping those structures flexible and efficient.

| Design Pattern | Practice completed? |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Adapter        | ❌                   |
| Bridge         | ❌                   |
| Composite      | ❌                   |
| Decorator      | ❌                   |
| Facade         | ❌                   |
| Flyweight      | ❌                   |
| Proxy          | ❌                   |

### Behavioral patterns

\- takes care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

| Design Pattern              | Practice completed? |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Chain of Responsibility     | ❌                   |
| Command                     | ❌                   |
| Iterator                    | ❌                   |
| Mediator                    | ❌                   |
| Memento                     | ❌                   |
| Observer                    | ❌                   |
| [State](/Behavioral/State/) | ✅                   |
| Strategy                    | ❌                   |
| Template Method             | ❌                   |
| Visitor                     | ❌                   |
